# Detailed Design

This document presents a comprehensive overview of the Control Unit (CU) subsystem, one of the four primary components of the automated chessboard system; the other subsystems including the Processing Unit, CoreXY Unit, Power Unit, and Peripherals Unit. While the primary focus is on the Control Unit, this document also provides a high-level integration perspective with the remaining subsystems, in order to illustrate the CU’s role in coordinating communication, motion, and actuation across the entire system. Additionally, the document outlines the key technical constraints, relevant electrical and safety standards, and operational requirements that guide the subsystem’s design and implementation. Finally, it describes the proposed circuitry, communication methods, and control logic necessary to construct and validate the Control Unit as a critical part of the complete automated chessboard solution.

## Function of the Subsystem

The Control Unit (CU) serves as the central command interface between the Processing Unit and the physical motion components of the automated chessboard. Acting as the intermediary between high-level logic and low-level hardware control, the CU receives validated chess move commands from the Raspberry Pi over a serial UART connection and translates them into precise motor and actuator operations. The two stepper motors driven by the Control Unit are physically part of the CoreXY subsystem, and the Control Unit’s responsibility is limited to generating the STEP/DIR control signals required to operate them. The subsystem is responsible for generating synchronized STEP and DIR signals to drive two stepper motors that operate the CoreXY mechanism, enabling coordinated movement across the chessboard’s X and Y axes.

In addition to motion control, the CU manages the piece "pickup" mechanism through an electromagnet (controlled by a MOSFET switching circuit) that securely "grabs" and releases chess pieces during gameplay. To ensure safe and reliable operation, the CU continuously monitors limit switches, driver fault signals, and supply voltage, in addition to implementing safety protocols (such as immediate halting in the event of faults or out-of-range conditions). Motion profiling, including acceleration and deceleration phases, is integrated into the control logic to guarantee smooth and accurate piece movement. Through this coordinated functionality, the CU enables precise actuation of all chess moves, while both completing each move within five seconds and ensuring reliable piece capture and placement across the board.


## Specifications and Constraints

The Control Unit shall manage precise movement of the CoreXY mechanism by converting high-level commands from the Processing Unit into coordinated stepper motor signals via an Arduino Nano [2] and two TMC2209 stepper driver boards [3]. It shall also control the electromagnet assembly and monitor limit switches, driver fault pins, and supply voltage to ensure safe, predictable operation. The Control Unit shall maintain sufficient positional accuracy and responsiveness to reliably move standard chess pieces without misalignment or collision, while complying with electrical safety and communication standards.

### Performance Specifications

The Control Unit shall achieve stepper motor resolution sufficient to position the magnetic carriage within ±0.5mm of target coordinates, ensuring proper chess piece alignment on the board. This accuracy shall be maintained using microstepping features of the TMC2209 driver (up to 1/64 step precision) [3]. The subsystem shall process and execute commands from the Processing Unit with total latency under 50ms to ensure responsive gameplay and smooth motion transitions [2]. To meet gameplay requirements, the Control Unit shall complete any single piece movement within 5 seconds and achieve at least 95% successful collision-free captures across repeated operation cycles, ensuring stable and reliable play performance. TMC2209 drivers shall adhere to the recommended RMS current of 2A, and overtemperature or stallGuard fault conditions shall trigger a controlled stop [3]. The Arduino Nano shall operate from a 5V DC logic supply, while the motor supply shall not exceed 12V, following manufacturer voltage tolerances [2][3][5]. Each TMC2209 driver shall receive its motor power from a dedicated 12V supply rail provided by the Power Unit, independent of the 5V logic input. Motor-ground and logic-ground shall remain tied at a single reference point to avoid ground loops while maintaining proper isolation between logic and load domains. 

The MOSFET-based switching circuit shall operate at logic-level voltage from the Arduino Nano, providing reliable on/off control with a maximum switching latency under 10ms and a current handling capacity consistent with the electromagnet’s rated draw. The MOSFET’s load path shall be powered from a dedicated 5V supply provided by the Power Unit, separate from the Arduino’s 5V logic domain, to prevent load-induced voltage sag and ensure stable switching behavior. The MOSFET switching circuit includes an external flyback (protection) diode placed directly across the electromagnet (cathode to +5V, anode to MOSFET drain) to clamp inductive voltage spikes when the coil is switched off. A 100kΩ gate-pulldown resistor (keeps the MOSFET off at reset) and a small 100Ω series gate resistor (limits edge speed and ringing) are installed between the Arduino gate pin and the MOSFET gate; the MOSFET source, Arduino ground, and the 5V load ground shall be tied to a common system ground. Two small SMT heatsinks shall be installed on the TMC2209 driver ICs (one heatsink per driver module) to improve thermal dissipation during sustained or high-current operation. These heatsinks shall be attached using electrically insulating, thermally conductive adhesive pads and must not create conductive pathways to adjacent circuitry. Thermal mitigation via heatsinks is intended to reduce the frequency of driver thermal throttling/shutdown, but the drivers shall still rely on their internal over-temperature protection as the final safety measure. [3] All thermal assessments in the design shall assume heatsink-equipped drivers. 

### Electrical and Signal Standards Compliance

The Control Unit shall comply with FCC Part 15 Subpart B regulations for unintentional radiators to prevent electromagnetic interference with nearby devices [1]. All electrical connections and enclosures shall meet the safety practices defined in UL 60950-1 (legacy IT equipment safety) and NFPA 70 (National Electrical Code) for proper grounding, wiring isolation, and overcurrent protection [5][6]. All grounding, bonding, and protective-earth connections shall comply with OSHA 29 CFR 1910 Subpart S to minimize electrical shock hazards, ensuring that all exposed conductive parts are properly bonded and protected by appropriate circuit-level fusing [9]. All flexible cables, cord sets, and connectors shall comply with NEC Article 400, using conductors and insulation rated for system voltage and current, with secure routing that avoids sharp edges, pinch points, or mechanical stress [6]. Signal-level communication between the Control Unit and Processing Unit shall occur via UART serial protocol at 9600bps, ensuring reliable and deterministic command transfer [7]. Stepper motor control signals shall operate within voltage and current ranges defined in the TMC2209 datasheet to ensure thermal stability and driver integrity [3]. For production and safe assembly, heatsinks and any adhesive/thermal pads used on driver modules shall be electrically non-conductive and compliant with the insulation practices required by UL 60950-1 and NFPA 70; the assembly process must maintain the creepage and clearance distances called out by these standards. [5][6] The MOSFET control circuit for the electromagnet shall comply with UL 60950-1 and NFPA 70 standards for low-voltage DC switching, ensuring proper isolation between control and load circuits and limiting gate-source voltage to within manufacturer specifications [5][6].

### Environmental and Safety Constraints

The subsystem shall operate in ambient temperatures from 0°C to 40°C and humidity up to 70% non-condensing, suitable for indoor educational environments [2]. External surfaces shall remain below 40 °C (104 °F) during continuous operation in accordance with UL 94 flammability and CPSC thermal safety guidelines (16 CFR 1505.7) to prevent user burns or component deformation [10][11]. All wiring shall be neatly routed to avoid mechanical stress, pinch points, or accidental disconnection during operation. Insulation and cable management shall meet the minimum requirements specified in NFPA 70 [6]. Although passive SMT heatsinks are expected to provide adequate dissipation for targeted RMS currents in normal indoor use, the design shall allow for modest airflow (unobstructed vents or a small fan slot) in case thermal testing shows sustained elevated driver case temperatures. Driver junction temperature shall remain below the maximum junction temperature specified in the TMC2209 datasheet under expected operating currents and duty cycles; if thermal testing shows temperatures approaching the limit, either reduce continuous RMS current, add active cooling, or revise movement profiles to reduce duty cycle. All heatsinks shall be secured to avoid loosening during transport and must not contact moving mechanical parts. [3]

### Ethical and Socio-Economic Considerations

The subsystem shall adhere to the ACM Code of Ethics [4], emphasizing accurate documentation, safe system design, and responsible development practices. Open-source hardware and software platforms (Arduino IDE and compatible libraries) shall be used to promote educational accessibility and reproducibility. To minimize cost and e-waste, components shall be sourced from domestic distributors offering tax-exempt educational sales, such as Digi-Key and McMaster-Carr, aligning with the project’s sustainability and accessibility goals [8].

## Overview of Proposed Solution

The Control Unit subsystem shall use an Arduino Nano to coordinate motion across the CoreXY mechanism (an Arduino Uno can be substituted, if the Nano cannot be ordered), generating microstepped motor signals through two TMC2209 stepper drivers (two TMC2208 stepper drivers should be able to be substituted, if the TMC2209 cannot be ordered). These drivers provide smooth, accurate positioning within ±0.5mm and support collision-free piece movement through 1/64 microstepping and controlled current regulation. The subsystem shall process UART commands from the Processing Unit at 9600bps with a total response latency under 50ms, ensuring responsive gameplay and reliable electromagnet operation for chess piece movement. Each TMC2209 module will be fitted with a small SMT heatsink (Adafruit part 1493) placed and bonded per manufacturer recommendations. These passive sinks are expected to keep the drivers operating in the normal thermal envelope for the selected motor current settings during typical chessboard duty cycles. The UART interface between the Raspberry Pi 5 and Arduino Nano assumes a 3.3V-to-5V level shifting, provided by the Processing Unit via a logic level converter.

All electrical and mechanical elements shall comply with NFPA 70 (National Electrical Code), FCC Part 15 Subpart B, and UL 60950-1 for grounding, insulation, and interference protection. Wiring and enclosures shall meet NEC Article 400 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910 Subpart S for safe cable routing and protective bonding, while external surfaces shall remain below 40 °C per UL 94 and 16 CFR 1505.7 thermal safety standards. Components shall be RoHS-compliant and sourced from verified domestic distributors to support cost efficiency and sustainability. Collectively, these measures ensure the Control Unit operates precisely, safely, and reliably within the automated chess system.


## Interface with Other Subsystems

The Control Unit interfaces directly with the Processing Unit and CoreXY Unit, as well as interfacing indirectly with the Power Unit. The Control Unit coordinates data exchange, actuation, and system power delivery with these other subsystems. This integration ensures synchronized communication between software logic, motion hardware, and the electromagnet assembly (responsible for piece manipulation).

### Processing Unit Interface

Communication between the Processing Unit (a Raspberry Pi 5) and the Control Unit (Arduino Nano) shall occur via a dedicated UART serial connection operating at 9600 bps [7]. Because the Raspberry Pi 5 uses 3.3V logic and the Arduino Nano uses 5V logic, a bi-directional logic level converter is employed to safely translate signals between the two devices. Although this converter sits electrically between the Raspberry Pi and Arduino, it is formally part of the Processing Unit subsystem (rather than the Control Unit). Its selection, mounting, and wiring are therefore handled and documented within the Processing Unit design, while the Control Unit only specifies the electrical requirements necessary for safe UART integration. The Pi acts as the command source, transmitting compact binary messages representing validated chess moves. Each message consists of two sets of data: the first set specifies the source square, and the second set specifies the destination square. The Control Unit’s firmware continuously listens on its UART receive line, parsing each two-byte message into a structured motion command. Upon receipt, the Arduino interprets the square coordinates and generates corresponding movement profiles for the CoreXY system. After completing a motion or electromagnet operation, the Control Unit shall transmit a confirmation message back to the Processing Unit over the same UART interface. This return signal confirms successful receipt, parsing, and execution of the command, enabling closed-loop coordination and preventing command desynchronization between subsystems.

The Processing Unit also provides regulated 5V DC logic power to the Control Unit via a mini-B USB connection. This interface supplies sufficient current for the Arduino Nano and attached low-power peripherals, including the TMC2209 stepper driver logic inputs and MOSFET gate control circuit. To ensure safe operation, the USB ground and signal return paths are tied to the system common ground, as defined in NFPA 70 and OSHA 29 CFR 1910 Subpart S [6][9].

### CoreXY Interface

The Control Unit commands the CoreXY mechanism through two TMC2209 stepper driver modules, generating synchronized STEP and DIR signals for independent control of the X and Y motion axes [3]. The two stepper motors are integrated components of the CoreXY mechanical subsystem, and the Control Unit interfaces with them only through the stepper drivers. The firmware implements edge-prioritized movement logic to ensure consistent and collision-free piece translation: each chess piece first moves from the center of its square to the nearest edge in the direction of travel, proceeds along the grid edge (or along both edges in a zigzag path for diagonal moves), and finally returns to the center of the target square.

This motion pattern minimizes interference with adjacent pieces while maintaining accurate board alignment. The Control Unit also interfaces with an N-channel enhancement-mode MOSFET circuit that switches the electromagnet on and off. The Arduino’s digital output pin provides a 5V logic signal to the MOSFET gate, energizing the magnet only when a pickup or release operation is required. The electromagnet connects via a Grove-compatible 5V output port, simplifying integration and cable management within the CoreXY carriage assembly. The electromagnet’s 5V supply shall originate from a dedicated Power Unit 5V rail rather than the Arduino’s logic supply, ensuring adequate current delivery and preventing noise coupling into the logic subsystem.

The stepper drivers and and electromagnet share a common logic ground with the Arduino Nano. Proper current limiting and isolation between logic and load paths are maintained per UL 60950-1 and NEC Article 400 [5][6].

### Power Unit Interface

The Control Unit receives its primary operating power indirectly through the Processing Unit’s 5V USB output. This connection powers the Arduino Nano, the logic-side inputs of both TMC2209 drivers, and the MOSFET gate control line; however, the TMC2209 motor supply (12V) and the MOSFET load supply (5V) are provided directly by the Power Unit. All power and signal cables shall conform to NEC Article 400 specifications for flexible cords and cables, ensuring rated insulation, strain relief, and secure routing to avoid pinch points or abrasion [6]. Grounding and bonding follow OSHA 29 CFR 1910 Subpart S, ensuring that the Control Unit’s enclosure and ground planes are properly connected to protective earth [9]. This structured power distribution ensures stable operation and compliance with applicable electrical safety codes, while maintaining a compact and modular interface layout between subsystems. The electromagnet’s MOSFET switching circuit shall draw from a separate regulated 5V output of the Power Unit to isolate load current from the Control Unit’s logic supply.

In addition to supplying 5V logic power through the Processing Unit, the Power Unit shall directly provide a stable 12V rail to each TMC2209 driver module for motor power. These 12V lines shall be routed separately from the 5V logic wiring to reduce noise injection and comply with isolation requirements.

## Analysis

The Control Unit (CU) design emphasizes precise motion control, robust electrical safety, and reliable subsystem integration. Using an Arduino Nano as the central controller ensures sufficient computational ability to interpret binary chess move commands from the Raspberry Pi 5, as well as generate real-time microstepped signals for the TMC2209 stepper drivers [2][3]. The Nano’s 16 MHz clock and lightweight firmware architecture allow it to process incoming UART commands with a total response latency under 50ms, well within the performance requirements for responsive chessboard actuation. The use of 1/64 microstepping on the TMC2209 drivers provides positional resolution sufficient to achieve ±0.5mm alignment of the magnetic carriage, meeting the accuracy constraints for collision-free piece movement [3]. The integrated acceleration and deceleration profiles ensure smooth motion along the CoreXY axes, preventing overshoot or abrupt stops that could misalign pieces.

The MOSFET-based electromagnet control circuit offers reliable actuation with minimal latency (<10 ms) while protecting the controller from inductive spikes via the included flyback diode. Separating the 5V logic supply from the MOSFET’s load supply ensures voltage stability and prevents switching noise from propagating into the Arduino or stepper drivers. Proper gate resistors and pulldown configuration further mitigate ringing and inadvertent activation, providing predictable and safe electromagnetic operation. With the MOSFET rated to handle the 400mA electromagnet current, plus a flyback diode capable of clamping voltage spikes, the design ensures long-term reliability and safety during repeated actuation cycles.

Thermal considerations are addressed through the use of SMT heatsinks on each TMC2209 driver. Passive thermal management is sufficient for expected duty cycles under 2A RMS motor currents, reducing the likelihood of driver thermal throttling while remaining compatible with UL 60950-1 and NFPA 70 insulation and clearance requirements [3][5][6]. The separation of 12V motor rails from the 5V logic domain minimizes electrical noise and adheres to grounding best practices, reducing the potential for signal interference or ground loops. Wiring and cable routing follow NEC Article 400 standards, ensuring mechanical protection and safe operation in an indoor environment.

Subsystem interfacing demonstrates robust coordination with the Processing Unit, CoreXY mechanism, and Power Unit. The bi-directional UART link (with level conversion) allows reliable communication between 3.3V and 5V logic domains, supporting closed-loop confirmation of each move and preventing desynchronization [7]. The CoreXY interface supports precise trajectory execution, while the MOSFET-controlled electromagnet enables secure chess piece manipulation. Power distribution through separate regulated rails for logic, motor, and load ensures stable operation under varying command sequences.

The design also satisfies environmental and safety constraints, operating effectively in 0°C–40°C ambient temperatures and up to 70% non-condensing humidity. External surfaces remain below 40°C under continuous operation, in compliance with UL 94 and CPSC thermal safety guidelines [10][11]. All components and assembly practices are consistent with FCC Part 15 Subpart B, OSHA 29 CFR 1910 Subpart S, and NFPA 70 requirements, providing safe and reliable operation for educational and laboratory use [1][6][9]. Ethical and socio-economic considerations are addressed by using open-source hardware and accessible, RoHS-compliant components sourced from domestic distributors, promoting reproducibility and sustainability [4][8].

On the whole, this analysis demonstrates that the Control Unit design fulfills its functional objectives, meets performance and accuracy requirements, and adheres to electrical, thermal, and safety standards. The subsystem is capable of executing precise, reliable chessboard motion and actuation, while maintaining safe operation and compliance with applicable regulatory and ethical standards.
