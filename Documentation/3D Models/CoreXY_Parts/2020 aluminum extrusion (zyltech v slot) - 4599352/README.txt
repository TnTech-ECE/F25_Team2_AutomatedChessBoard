2020 aluminum extrusion (zyltech v slot) by 3dpKid on Thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4599352

Summary:
I sketched up this rough model of a aluminum extrusion for use in building 3d printers in cad. It can be used to model parts off of in cad and can be printed out to text fit parts if you don't have an aluminum extrusion on hand. I hope this helps some of you working on building or modding your 3d printers.
