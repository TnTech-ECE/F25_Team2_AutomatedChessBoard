## Meeting Minutes
Date: 11-24-2025

* Group discussed CoreXY bracket to hold Control Unit components and one Processing Unit component (level shifter)
* Noah brought up using perfboard and CoreXY bracket rather than PCB for Control Unit.
* Nathan brought up new electromagnet for holding force concerns. Group decided that Nathan should do more research/math to figure out if a magnet with a greater holding force (but same relative size/weight) is needed.
* Level shifter power concerns and pinout was addressed by Jack and Lewis.
* Nathan addressed new, smaller size of pieces (resulting in smaller board).
