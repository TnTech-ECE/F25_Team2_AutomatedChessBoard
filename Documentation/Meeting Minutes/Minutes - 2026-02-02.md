## Meeting Minutes
Date: 02-02-2026

* Plan to meet up Wednesday for rough draft overview of presentation
* Questions for Storm:
* 1.) Ask about progress on grading Detailed Design 
* 2.) Ask about presentation (rough time, focus - parts biggest focus?, how professional)
* Answers: 10 - 15 minutes (but no minimum, focus on parts; lead with brief overview of function, can be a little funny)

Date: 02-04-2026

* All team members gave presentations and got feedback
* Discuss parts ordering (do it next Wednesday?)
